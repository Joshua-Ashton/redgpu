RedGpuSDK_v1.0.2.zip is now available for all REDGPU SDK users and it comes with RedGpuSDKSwiftProgramTemplate.zip for programming GPUs with the [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming language on Linux.

RedGpuSDKSwiftProgramTemplate is a simple executable program created with [Swift 5.1.2](https://swift.org/download/)’s Package Manager that contains a basic code to initialize a REDGPU context and print information about all the available GPUs on your system. The program has access to all of the REDGPU API and it can do everything the original C99 API can: CPU and GPU memory copies, draws, async compute.

To build and run the program, just open a terminal window, cd into the program’s folder and run:

```
swift run
```

If you followed the installation guides from the REDGPU SDK, and you have [Swift 5.1.2](https://swift.org/download/) (or higher) installed on your system, then it should build and run successfully. Otherwise, you can get help by emailing to iamvfx@gmail.com or sending a direct message to [twitter.com/redgpus](https://twitter.com/redgpus)

Have fun programming GPUs with REDGPU API, the best GPU API in the world, and Swift programming language on Linux!
